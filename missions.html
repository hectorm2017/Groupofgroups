        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Henry Fisher and Hector Mendoza started the Personal Information Index, or PI², because they were tired of seeing countless companies take user data and privately sell it to unknown businesses and organizations with no idea of what they might do with it.</p>
        <p>That's why Henry and Hector set out to create a revolutionary new platform in which data collection and selling is not only more transparent than ever, but also easier as well.</p>
        <p>Companies interested in buying data can browse the PI² website and find any information they need, and when ready, can easily check out through our secure, encrypted servers.
        <p>Through the Personal Information Index’s revolutionary new method of data commerce, we want to help users more effectively keep track of their data and how it’s used, while at the same time making it easier for businesses and organizations to use that data for the progress and betterment of humanity.</p>
