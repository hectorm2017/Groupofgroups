        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Henry Fisher and Hector Mendoza started the Personal Information Index, or PI², because they were tired of seeing people's data not properly being utilized in making user's lives catered to their needs. With modern-day data collection, hundreds of companies have access to infinite information about every citizen without a central way to control it--making the information near useless.</p>
        <p>That's why Henry and Hector set out to create a revolutionary new platform in which data collection and selling is not only more transparent than ever, but also centralized and easy to manage from one place. Companies interested in buying data can browse the PI² website and find any information they need, and when ready, can easily check out a person's information through our secure, encrypted servers. We pride ourselves in only holding 100% factual information on every individual, and the most in-depth of any service to ever exist--as we compile information from hundreds of other data brokers. 
        <p>Through the Personal Information Index’s revolutionary new method of data commerce, we want to help companies and individuals more effectively use other's data to better benefit society as a whole. For only $19.99, you can purchase any individual's private information without their knowledge, click our Profiles tab to get started on your first purchase! </p>
